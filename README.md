## Overview

DermBase is a robust iOS application aimed to serve both dermatologists and patients by providing a comprehensive database of dermatological medications. With features like search, filter, and user account management, DermBase streamlines the process of finding the right medication for specific dermatological conditions. DermBase is your go-to app for an all-encompassing dermatology reference, giving you access to a vast array of medication information at your fingertips. We understand the intricacies of dermatological healthcare and aim to simplify the process of finding suitable treatments. With our user-friendly interface and advanced filter options, DermBase bridges the gap between healthcare providers and the latest dermatologic drugs. Unleash the power to filter medications based on age, pregnancy, mode of delivery, and FDA approval years, and provide evidence-based medicine.

DISCLAIMER: All the data presented in the app is based on publicly available FDA-approved full product information (FPI) of the medications. Furthermore, each medication's details include a reference that gives a link to the FPI for that medication. While DermBase aims to provide accurate and up-to-date medication information, it is intended to supplement, and not replace professional medical advice. In addition to using this app, please seek a doctorâ€™s advice before making any medical decisions.
